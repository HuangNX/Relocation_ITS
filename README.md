## Built environment and travel behavior change: Causal inference analysis based on behavioral big data of relocated residents

### Abstract
The causal effect of changes in built environment on travel behavior is increasingly emphasized in behavioral research, particularly in the process of urban renewal. Due to the lack of real longitudinal research designs, there is still no consensus on the long-term causal effects of built environment and the adaptation process of residents to changes in built environment. To address this issue, this study, based on the full-year mobile signaling data of individuals who relocated in Shenzhen from May to July 2019, develops a interrupted time series method for longitudinal research design. Our goal is to evaluate the impact of multidimensional changes in the built environment on travel behavior in the context of active spatial adjustment caused by relocation, obtaining initial and long-term effects of built environment change interventions. The study finds that spatial adjustments can change residents' travel behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of community planning. Additionally, different elements of the built environment have varying effects on travel behavior, and the impact of the same built environment element also differs over time. suggesting that policymakers should formulate planning interventions flexibly and with specificity, and should adopt a patient, long-term perspective in planning and evaluation.
